## Introduction

The purpose of this program is to automate the process of creating accurate lyric files for audio tracks. This involves transcribing the audio, synchronizing the lyrics with the music, and ensuring the text matches the original lyrics.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Python and working with text files.
- Familiarity with the SRT and LRC file formats.

## Installation

1. Install the Whisper-JAX library using pip:

    ```shell
    pip install whisper-jax
    ```

2. Set up your Python development environment with your preferred IDE or text editor.

## Transcription Process

Use Whisper-JAX to transcribe audio files to text. The transcription will then be formatted into SRT files with timestamps.

## SRT File Handling

Write a Python script to parse the transcribed text into the SRT format. This involves creating timestamped entries for each line of the transcription.

## Lyrics Comparison and Correction

Develop a comparison algorithm to match the AI-generated transcription against the original lyrics. Correct any discrepancies found during the comparison.

## LRC Format Conversion

Convert the corrected SRT files into the LRC format, ensuring that timestamps and text are properly formatted according to LRC standards.

## Testing

Thoroughly test the program with various audio files to ensure the transcriptions are accurate and the synchronization is precise.

## Deployment

Package your program for deployment. This could be a web-based application or a standalone desktop application, depending on your target audience.

## Support

Provide documentation and support for users to troubleshoot common issues or provide feedback for improvements.
